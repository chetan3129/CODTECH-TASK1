**Project:**  Housing Price Prediction using LINEAR REGRESSION

**Objective:** To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts median house values in California based on key features.

**Key Activities:**

**-->Data Loading and Preparation:** Load the California housing dataset (california_housing_train.csv). Handle missing values by filling them with the mean.
**-->Feature Selection:** Select relevant features for the model (total rooms, total bedrooms, median income).
**-->Data Splitting:** Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
**-->Model Training:** Train a linear regression model on the training data.
**-->Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

**-->Technology Used:**

Python
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
Linear Regression (machine learning algorithm)
